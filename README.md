## Drift

Productivity one step at a time
Drift: The extension that trains you to be productive.

Ever found yourself on your favorite social media site 5 minutes after closing it? Has this habit stuck to you during work?

Drift helps train you to become more productive through a gradual process. It works first by monitoring how much time you spend on distracting websites. After the monitoring phase, the extension records how long you've spent on that website. Each day, it will gradually lower the amount of time you get to spend on that site. If you exceed the time limit, the site will be blocked until it refreshes for your selected time period.

You can select the sites you want to add to your list in the "options" page, located under "More Tools" > "Extensions". Then, when you are ready to start tracking, click the extension icon on the top right of your browser; you will see a timer showing you how much time you have left on the selected page.
